# Cloud Android Orchestration

This repo holds source for a Cuttlefish Cloud Orchestration application. The
Orchestration application allows to create, delete and connect to Cuttlefish
devices in the cloud.

The application is developed for and tested on Google Cloud Platform, but it's
designed in a way that should allow its deployment in other Cloud solutions
without much trouble.
